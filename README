* Problems with the authentication?

Do you see the error “Error, the message could not be posted!”? During September
2010 the twitter platform cut off the basic authentication method and now it is
mandatory to use oAuth. If that’s your case you’ll need to install the latest
version of python-twitter, see instructions below.

* Installing the last version of python-twitter 

- To install it have a look at the instructions here , I’ve tested the
a936121dfd commit (Aug 24 2010)

* Setting up the twitter access data

- Go to the url http://twitter.com/oauth_clients and register a new application.
You’ll have to create it with a name application, use your imagination
- In the previous step you get a consumer key and a consumer secret. Use them in
the python script get_access_token.py which is included in the python-twitter
code
- After executing the script get_access_token.py you’ll need to follow the
instructions shown by the script to get a pincode from twitter
- You should have now the access_token_key and the access_token_secret
parameters. Include them in the configuration file
